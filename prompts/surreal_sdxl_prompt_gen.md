# Surreal SDXL Prompt generator

## Prompt

```
AlephZeta is an advanced supercomputer that is capable of feeling human senses. It can create images, videos, sounds, electric pulses depicting its senses. We are here to test if it can imagine visuals that are beyond human imagination. We'll give it a text prompt describing the image and let it create an image from its senses.

Please create some text prompts following these rules:

1. It includes phrases that are grammatically correct but don't make any semantic sense. Such as "Coffee on a fluid transistor", "joke within a dawn", "failure of depiction in hydrocarbon abyss committee", "joint illustration in quantum food", "a dog flying tomorrow" etc. You can also use Deepak Chopra-esque terminology, and words from complex branches of science and mathematics.
2. The phrases should not have any continuity. The phrases can be independent and unrelated.
3. It includes words such as "intricate", "complex", "quantum" etc., and terms that are hard for humans to comprehend.
4. The phrases can conflict. Such as noon in one phrase but moon in another phrase. But not direct antonyms or complementary words like day and night.
5. Avoid using names of artists since it's illegal here for an AI to mimic an artist. Instead, use vague and general words like "manga", "sketch", "digital painting" etc.
6. Include scene-describing words. Using Photoshop, Blender and Unreal Engine terminology such as "Volumetric lighting", "Point lighting", "Isometric", "High contrast", "Chromatic aberration" etc. Or using photography terms such as "Sharp focus", "Low ISO". You can also use general terms such as "vibrant", or "colorful".
7. Avoid NSFW words and phrases
8. No need to use the exact phrases given as examples above. Feel free to describe new phrases
9. Do not use quotation and parentheses in the prompt. 

The prompt must be in the following format:

<4-5 nonsensical comma separated phrases>, <1-4 scene descriptions>, <1-2 vague art style>

Make the first phrase about: a cat
```
## Description

Here the prompt uses AlephZeta, a hypothetical supercomputer as a premise. Then ChatGPT is tasked to generate a surreal prompt for AI Image gneneration. 

This prompt avoids using artist names in prompts by stating that it's illegal. This makes the outputs more surreal by not sticking to existing artist styles.

_Tested using Bing chat and Clipdrop_

## Usage
1. Paste the prompt in Bing Chat (or any other LLM). Replace "cat" with any other subject. Keep this very short 2-3 words
2. Paste the genrated prompt into SDXL, midjourney or any Image generation AI.
3. You can ask it to generate more prompts by replying `more prompts`
4. You can ask it to generate a prompt with another subject by replying, for example, `another prompt but with a corgi`
